//  A variable is a container for storing data
//  A vairable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

//  Two steps:
//  1. Declaration (var, let, const)
//  2. Assignment (= assignment operator)

let firstName = "Bryant"; // string
let age = 21; // numbers
let student = true; //booleans

age = age +1;

console.log(age);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(student);
